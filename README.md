### Add more aphorisms

```
mkdir $HOME/.aphorism
touch $HOME/.aphorism/my_category.txt
```

Add new content to any number of `.txt` files in your `$HOME/.aphorism` directory, separating each aphorism from the prior entry with a `%` symbol on a newline.  Feel free to use spacing and newlines and tabs as you see fit for formatting; the gem will respect your spacing.

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, commit the change, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
